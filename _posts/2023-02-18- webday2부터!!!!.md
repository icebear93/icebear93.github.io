# WEB

## HTML

 basic of web programming

```html
1. `<h1></h1>`: Heading 1 - Represents the top-level heading in a document. It's the most important and largest heading.

2. `<a href="" target="_blank"></a>`: Hyperlink - Creates a clickable link to another web page or resource. The `href` attribute specifies the URL, and the `target="_blank"` attribute opens the link in a new browser tab or window.

3. `<strong></strong>`: Strong Emphasis - Renders text in bold to give it stronger importance or emphasis.

4. `<ol></ol>`: Ordered List - Creates a numbered list of items. Each item is represented by an `<li></li>` element within the `<ol>` container.

5. `<li></li>`: List Item - Represents an item in a list, whether in an ordered (`<ol>`) or unordered (`<ul>`) list.

6. `<p></p>`: Paragraph - Defines a paragraph of text, creating a block-level container for content.

7. `<img src="path/to/image.jpg" width="100px">`: Image - Embeds an image into the document. The `src` attribute specifies the image source (path), and the `width` attribute sets the image width to 100 pixels.

8. `<br>`: Line Break - Inserts a line break, forcing content after the `<br>` tag to appear on a new line.

9. `<u></u>`: Underline - Renders text with an underline, typically used to indicate that the text is a hyperlink.

10. `<!-- ... -->`: Comment - Used to add comments within the HTML code. Comments are not displayed on the webpage and are meant for developers to provide notes.

11. `<div></div>`: Division - A generic container used for structuring content or applying CSS styles. It doesn't have any specific semantic meaning.

12. `<span></span>`: Span - Similar to a `<div>`, but it's an inline-level element, often used for applying styles to specific portions of text within a larger block of content.

13. `<button></button>`: Button - Creates an interactive button that users can click on. It's often used for triggering actions or submitting forms.

14. `<input type="text" placeholder="Enter Title">`: Creates a text input field where the placeholder text "Enter Title" is displayed faintly as a hint to the user.

15. `<input type="text" value="010-" readonly>`: Generates a text input field with the initial value "010-" which is set to be read-only, meaning the user cannot modify the value.

16. `<textarea rows="13" cols="50"></textarea>`: Produces a textarea element with a height of 13 rows and a width of 50 columns, allowing the user to input text of up to 50 characters per line.

```



## CSS

style of web; there are two ways to define sytle of the web

1. 

```html
<div style="background-color: skyblue; margin: 50px 100px 150px 200px;">
    <!-- Set margin (external spacing) on top, right, bottom, and left -->
    Area enclosed by the <strong>div</strong> tag<br>
    Applying specific style
</div>

<div style="background-color: #F2CB61; width: 180px; padding: 50px;">
    <!-- Set padding: 50px for spacing around the content -->
    Area enclosed by the <strong>div</strong> tag<br>
    Applying specific style<br>
    Margin within the inner area
</div>

`margin` & `padding`: CSS Properties - These properties control spacing around elements. `margin` defines space outside an element's border, while `padding` defines space within an element's border.
```



2. 

```html
<head>
<style>
    /* CSS rules can be defined within the <head> tag */
    /* Selectors and styles are enclosed in curly braces { ... } */
    /* # indicates an ID selector, which takes precedence over a class */

    /* Example of a CSS rule targeting a tag */
    tag {
        property: value;
    }

    /* Example of a CSS rule targeting an ID */
    #elementID {
        property: value;
    }

    /* Example of a CSS rule targeting a class */
    .className {
        property: value;
    }
</style>
</head>

1. `<head>`: The `<head>` section of an HTML document contains metadata and other non-visible information about the webpage.

2. `<style>`: The `<style>` tag is used to define CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) rules for styling HTML elements.

3. CSS Rules: Inside the `<style>` tag, CSS rules are defined. A CSS rule consists of a selector (which specifies which elements the rule applies to) and a set of properties and values enclosed in curly braces `{ ... }`.

4. Tag Selector: The example shows how to target a specific HTML tag and apply styles to it.

5. ID Selector (`#`): IDs are unique identifiers assigned to specific HTML elements. Styles defined with an ID selector take precedence over those defined with a class selector.

6. Class Selector (`.`): Classes are used to apply the same styles to multiple elements. While classes are powerful, an ID selector has higher specificity.
```

the lines below are the example!

```html
<style>
    a{
      color:red;
      text-decoration: none;
    }
    h1{
    font-size: 100px;
    text-align:center;
    }
   
   .saw{
   color: grey;
   }
   
   #active{
   color : blue;
   }
  
  
```

advanced css

```html
<style>
    /* Applying styles to both h1 and a elements */
    h1, a {
        /* Creating a red border around the elements */
        border: 5px solid red;

        /* Removing underlines from anchor elements (hyperlinks) */
        text-decoration: none;

        /* The above three lines can also be written individually like this:
        border-width: 5px;
        border-style: solid;
        border-color: red; */
    }
</style>


1. `h1, a`: This selector applies the defined styles to both `<h1>` (heading) and `<a>` (anchor) elements. Multiple selectors can be grouped together using a comma to apply the same styles to different elements.

2. `border: 5px solid red;`: This rule sets a red border with a width of 5 pixels around the selected elements. The `border` shorthand property combines `border-width`, `border-style`, and `border-color` into a single declaration.

3. `text-decoration: none;`: For anchor elements (`<a>`), this rule removes the default underline styling that is applied to hyperlinks, resulting in links without underlines.
