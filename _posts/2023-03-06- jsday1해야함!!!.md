## Basics of Javascript

### 1. Error checking and basic concepts

- **JavaScript Statements**: In JavaScript, statements are separated by semicolons (`;`).

- **Comments**: To add comments in JavaScript, use `//` for a single line comment or `/* */` for multi-line comments.

- **Error Handling**: Unlike some languages that display error messages directly, JavaScript might not show any response if there's an error. To check for errors, you can use the developer tools in a web browser. Look for a red "x" icon or open the console tab to see error messages.

- **Script Tag**: JavaScript code is written inside `<script>` tags in HTML documents.

- **Testing in Chrome**: To run a simple test, type `about:blank` in Google Chrome's address bar to open a blank page, then press `Cmd + Opt + I` (on Mac) or the equivalent shortcut on your platform to open the console tab. Here, you can perform simple operations and see the results.

- **Execution Order**: JavaScript is executed before HTML content is rendered on the page.

- **Alert Function**: `alert("hello react");` displays a pop-up message when the web page is opened.

- **Console.log**: 

  ```
  console.log("hello");
  ```

   prints the result to the console. It's used for debugging and checking results during development.

  - Special Characters: Use `\` before special characters to display them as they are, e.g., `console.log("h\"ell\"o");` prints `h"ell"o`.
  - Tab and Newline: Use `\t` for a tab space and `\n` for a new line, e.g., `console.log("동해\t물과\t백두산이\n마르고\\ 닳도록");`.
  - String Concatenation: Use `+` to concatenate strings, e.g., `console.log("가나다"+"라마");`.
  - Accessing Characters: You can access specific characters in a string like an array, e.g., `console.log("가나다라마"[3]);`.
  - String Length: Use the `.length` property to get the length of a string, e.g., `console.log("가나다라마".length);`.

- **Basic Operators**:

  - Arithmetic: Simple arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division can be performed.
  - Modulus: Use `%` for modulus operation, e.g., `console.log(5%3);`.
  - Comparison: Use comparison operators to compare values, e.g., `console.log(5>3);`.
  - Equality: Use `===` for strict equality comparison, e.g., `console.log(5===3);`.
  - Logical Operators: Use `&&` for logical AND, `||` for logical OR, and `!` for logical NOT.
  - Ternary Operator: Use `condition ? true : false` for conditional operations.
  - Typeof: Use `typeof` to check the type of a variable, e.g., `console.log(typeof(100));`.

- **Template Literals**: Use backticks (```) and `${}` to embed expressions within strings, e.g., `console.log(`Expression 1+2 is ${1+2}`);`.

- **Variables and Constants**:

  - Constants: Use `const` to declare constants. A constant cannot be reassigned, e.g., `const pi = 3.14;`.
  - Variables: Use `let` to declare variables. Variables can be reassigned, but cannot be redeclared within the same scope, e.g., `let x = 10;`.

- **Document.write()**: Use `document.write()` to write HTML formatted strings directly to the document, e.g., `document.write("<h1>Hello, World!</h1>");`.
