# DNA sequencing

## motif : CCGGAA

While studying biology, I encountered an intriguing set of code related to DNA sequencing using deep learning. Initially, the logic behind the code was challenging to grasp, but I quickly became fascinated by its potential. This marked the beginning of my journey into studying AI.

below is the DNA sequencing code
